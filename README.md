# Wiwaha

The purpose of this website is to enable you to get all your wedding requirements under one roof. This has now been developed in such a way that you may find a photographer and that photographer can share his service with others. 
You can now find the photographer you want for your wedding through this website. That is what I have offered you for now. 
One may provide his service to the customers through this website. 
For example: if there is a photographer he can promote his service through this website and provide his service to others.
In addition, a customer can get the service from different photographers.
A customer can find not only a photographer but also everything required for a wedding through this website.
